        M. Cookies
        Our website uses cookies. A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of
        letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored
        by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser
        requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or
        “session” cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will
        remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry
        date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session,
        when the web browser is closed. Cookies do not typically contain any information
        that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you
        may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies. {SELECT
        ACCURATE PHRASING We use only session cookies / only persistent cookies / both
        session and persistent cookies on our website.}

        website’s usability / analyze the use of the website / administer the
        website / prevent fraud and improve the security of the website /
        personalize the website for each user / target advertisements which may
        be of particular interest to specific users / describe purpose(s)};
        2. Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies—for example:
        a. in Internet Explorer (version 10) you can block cookies using the
